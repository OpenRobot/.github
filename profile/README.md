    <summary>Where is LyricMaster-Bot?</summary>
    <ul>
        <br>
        OpenRobot used to be called as LyricMaster-Bot. LyricMaster-Bot is the legacy of OpenRobot. 
        Since then, LyricMaster-Bot has been growing, with other partners.
        The developers and owners of LyricMaster-Bot was thinking to rename LyricMaster-Bot organization because:
        <ul>
            <li>LyricMaster-Bot organization was growing quickly with other bots than LyricMaster</li>
            <li>There was also other bots e.g M.S. Counter and Fifi</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The developers thought that this was the time to change the name of LyricMaster-Bot organization.
        We (<a href="https://github.com/proguy914629bot">proguy914629bot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whyfai">whyfai</a>) searched for names available.
        <br>
        We brainstormed and thought about these ideas:
        <ul>
            <li>MemeStudios</li>
            <li>OpenBots</li>
            <li>OpenBot</li>
            <li>OpenProject</li>
            <li>OpenRobot</li>
            <li>OpenRobots</li>
            <li>OpenProjects</li>
            <li>OpenDeveloper</li>
            <li>OpenDevelopers</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We thought those options through one by one, and agreed that OpenRobot was the best. We didn't pick the others because of either 2 reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>The naming of it is bad</li>
            <li>It doesn't make sense with the context of the whole organization</li>
            <li>The names are already taken in GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        So here we are, changing the whole organization system and name.

    <summary>Where are all the repositories?</summary>
    <ul>
        <br>
        OpenRobot used to have around 20-30+ repositories. 
        Understanably so, <a href="https://github.com/whyfai">whyfai</a> removed the OpenRobot Organization, in result of <b><em>most</em></b> of OpenRobot's code being deleted, when we only had <b>some</b> backup left.
        <br>
        Though most OpenRobot Services such as our <a href="https://api.openrobot.xyz">API</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/users/759591316627128320">Discord Bot</a>, <a href="https://openrobot.xyz">Website</a>, Database and <a href="https://cdn.openrobot.xyz">CDN</a> are all still running perfectly fine.
